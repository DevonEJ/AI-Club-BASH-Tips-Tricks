# AI-Club-BASH-Tips-Tricks

This is a 30-minute command line tutorial produced for the Meet Up group, the [AI Club for Gender Minorities](https://www.meetup.com/ai-club/events/262441143/).

It also has accompanying [slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1LouUtvsGt6gTE8GnSLFyFCXImih5Dj4Y739G-KTRO3A/edit?usp=sharing).

## Set up instructions
 
 - Ensure you have a bash terminal installed (e.g. could be [Gitbash](https://gitforwindows.org/) if using a Windows machine - if using a Mac OS or a machine running Linux, you should have a bash terminal by default)
 - Download the pokemon.csv file
 - Extract it into a folder location on your local filesystem that is easy for you to find
